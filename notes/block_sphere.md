ğŸ§­ Altitude = Polar angle (Î¸)
	â€¢	This determines the relative probability of measuring the qubit in state |0âŸ© (North Pole) or |1âŸ© (South Pole).
	â€¢	Specifically, if the state vector makes an angle Î¸ from the z-axis, then:
	â€¢	Probability of measuring |0âŸ© = cosÂ²(Î¸/2)
	â€¢	Probability of measuring |1âŸ© = sinÂ²(Î¸/2)
So yes â€” altitude directly controls measurement probabilities in the computational basis.


âœ¨ Summary
â€¢	Altitude (Î¸) â†’ Affects probability of measuring |0âŸ© vs |1âŸ©.
â€¢	Latitude (Ï†) â†’ Affects relative phase, crucial for interference and entanglement, but not for plain Z-basis measurements.
