    "State fidelity in quantum computing is a quantitative measure of how close two quantum states are to each other. It is widely used to assess the accuracy of quantum computations, the performance of quantum gates, and the reliability of quantum error correction schemes.\n",
    "Mathematically, for two quantum states represented by density matrices  and , the state fidelity  is defined as:\n",
    "$F(\\rho, \\sigma) = \\left( \\operatorname{tr} \\sqrt{ \\sqrt{\\rho} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\rho} } \\right)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "For pure states  and , this simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of fidelity ranges from 0 (completely different states) to 1 (identical states). High state fidelity indicates that the actual quantum state is very close to the target or ideal state, while low fidelity means significant deviation, often due to noise, decoherence, or imperfect operations.\n",
    "In practice, state fidelity is crucial for:\n",
    "\t•\tEvaluating how well a quantum algorithm or gate has performed.\n",
    "\t•\tQuantifying the impact of noise and errors.\n",
    "\t•\tGuiding improvements in quantum hardware and error correction.\n",
    "In summary, state fidelity is a fundamental metric that quantifies the similarity between two quantum states, providing a direct measure of quantum system accuracy and reliability"
